title: "Mocktail Hot Buttered Rum"
---
I was participating in dry January but wanted to give hot buttered rum a go so in lieu of the traditional rum and hot water I used [vanilla chai tea](https://amzn.to/3AE6uLQ). 

Recipe makes 4 servings

## Ingredients: 
* 4 tea bags chai tea or apple cider
* 2/3 cup (145g) brown sugar
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
* 1/4 cup (85g) Honey
* 1tsp (3g) cinnamon
* 1/2tsp nutmeg
* 1/4tsp ground cloves
* pinch of salt
* 1tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions:
1. Boil water and brew your tea (or make up some apple cider!)
2. Put everything but the tea and vanilla in pot and heat until sugar isn't grainy (alternatively you can whip these ingredients together with a whisk if you want to save the remaining "batter" in the fridge/freezer in a log) 
3. Remove from heat and add vanilla
4. In each cup, 2 oz or 2 tbsp batter in the bottom of the mug/cup (optionally add up to 2 oz dark rum here), pour 6-8 oz hot water or tea or cider over that and mix. Taste and add more batter if desired. then top with optional but recommended whipped cream!
