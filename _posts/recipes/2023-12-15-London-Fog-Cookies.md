This recipe was inspired by [Hummingbird High](https://www.hummingbirdhigh.com/2020/04/lavender-earl-grey-cookies.html), but have tweaked this a bit as it has been a go to in my cookie repertoire over the last several years.

Time: 
* 1 hour 

Recipe makes around 24 cookies

## Ingredients: 
##### Dry ingredients
* 270g All Purpose Flour
* 5g Earl Grey Tea (either loose leaf or from tea bags)
* .5g [Dried Culinary Grade Lavender](https://amzn.to/47gDsAV)
* 2g Baking Powder
* 1.2g Baking Soda
* 3g Coarse Kosher Salt

##### Wet Ingredients
* 250g White Sugar
* 227g Unsalted Butter, room temp
* 1 Egg
* 2tsp [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3sfBM85)

##### Finishing
* 2tbsp White Sugar (for rolling)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350Â°F, line 2 [cookie sheets](https://amzn.to/3onii0g) with parchment paper.
2. Measure out Earl Grey Tea and Lavender into a spice grinder (I use a [magic bullet](https://amzn.to/3ttKLHg) with a [milling blade](https://amzn.to/41oYBr6)) to grind them finely 
3. Whisk together your dry ingredients in a bowl
4. In a [stand mixer](https://amzn.to/3RsVJVF) fitted with a [beater with a silicone edge](https://amzn.to/48hIr5c), mix your sugar and butter on medium speed until lightend in color and very fluffy (this will take a couple minutes). You may need to scrape your sides if using a standard beater attachement. While that's fluffing up, in a small bowl break your egg and mix your vanilla with it, then reduce the speed to low on your mixer and add your egg/vanilla until just combined. Then slowly add the dry ingredients again mixing until just combined - do not over mix!
5. Put approx 2 tbsp white sugar in a small bowl, then using a [2tbsp cookie scoop](https://amzn.to/3RniwlO), scoop a ball of dough into the small bowl of sugar and roll it, then place sugared cookie dough ball onto the prepped cookie sheet about 3 inches apart.
6. Bake the cookies for 12 minutes, the centers of the cookies will not look fully set but that's okay. Cool the cookies still on the hot pans on a wire racks (or on top of your stovetop grates) for 20 minutes. At this point the previously puffed cookies will have settled and get delightful crackled texture and the bottoms of the cookies will have set and be firm to the touch.
7. Enjoy!

## Notes 
If your butter is not room temperature you can allow it to warm up in the microwave and if you over heat it or your kitchen is warmer than room temperature you can put an icepack on the outside of mixing bowl while creaming the sugar and butter and you will know it's cool enough when it starts whipping up beautifully!
