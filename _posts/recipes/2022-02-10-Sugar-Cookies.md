This is my current sugar cookie recipe! I got some inspiration from [Baking with Kids](https://themotheroverload.com/baking-with-kids-eggless-sugar-cookies/), but have tweaked this quite a bit as this has spent much time in my notebook over the years.

Time: 
* 30 minutes to make the dough
* 2 hr cooling
* 1 hour to cut and bake

Recipe makes around 
* 60 3 in, 1/4 thick circle sugar cookies
_(Will revise as I make this recipe in the future.)_ 

## Ingredients: 
* 672g All Purpose Flour
* 6g (3/4 tsp) Salt 
* 21g (2 tsp) Baking Powder
* 150g White Sugar
* 3 Sticks Unsalted Butter, room temperature
* 9 tbsp (1/2c+1tbsp) of almond milk (or other milk) 
* 2.5 tsp [Vanilla Extract](https://amzn.to/3sfBM85)
* 1.5 tsp Almond Extract

## Instructions:
1. Measure out and whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt.
2. Cream the sugar and butter for a couple of minutes until super fluffy.
3. Add the vanilla and almond extracts and milk, combine. (If you don't have time to chill you can 1/3 the milk and it will impact only a little but will make a stiffer dough)
4. Incorporate the dry ingredients until just combined.
5. Chill until cold, and pliable. I usually do overnight, can probably get away with 30 minutes if you spread thin on a piece of parchment or in cling wrap. 
6. Take out about 1/4 of the dough leaving the rest in the fridge.
7. Dust your surface ([silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6)) with flour and work the dough just a little bit until pliable.
7. Make sure to dust your rolling pin well and roll out the dough to the thickness you want, I prefer 1/4 inch which I do perfectly with this [rolling pin](https://amzn.to/3ATF8BG).
8. Powder the cookie cutter, cut out the cookies. 
9. Using a thin spatula transition the cookies to a parchment/[silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6) covered [baking tray]((https://amzn.to/3onii0g).
10. Bake at 350F for about 8 minutes or until a touch golden on the bottom, or barely golden on and edge. 
11. Allow to cool on the pan for about 5 minutes to continue to bake through. 
12. Transer to a cooling rack, if you allow to cool completely on the tray the texture of the bottoms of the cookies will get strange. 

## Recommended Equipment 
* [Silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6)
* [Rolling pin with thickness rings](https://amzn.to/3ATF8BG)
* [Insulated baking sheet - large](https://amzn.to/3onii0g)

## Notes 
If your butter is not room temperature you can allow it to warm up in the microwave and if you over heat it or your kitchen is warmer than room temperature you can put an icepack on the outside of mixing bowl while creaming the sugar and butter and you will know it's cool enough when it starts whipping up beautifully. 


If you don't have time to chill you can 1/3 the milk and it will impact only a little but will make a stiffer dough.
