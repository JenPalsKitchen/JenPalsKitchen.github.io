Today is National Peanut Cluster Day! We are going to try them for the first time today. There seem to be so many ways to make them, I'm going to attempt to combine a bunch of ways I saw and see what happens.

Time: 
* 30 minutes to roast peanuts or candy peanuts
* 20 minutes cooling
* 30 minutes to coat in chocolate


## Ingredients: 
* 2 cups raw peanuts 
* 2 tbsp butter
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/3 cup water
* 12 oz chocolate chips
* optional cinnamon, chili powder, flaky salt

## Instructions:
### Candy Peanuts:
1. Prepare baking sheet with [silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6) or parchment paper.
2. Melt 2 tablespoon butter in a pan, then add the peanuts. Toast for a few minutes until you notice a little toastiness.
3. Add water and sugar into the pan. We will now make simple syrup and then continue to cook until it thickens up and coats the peanuts (about 15-30 minutes). Keep a close eye that the heat is not to high, and the color of the sugar is darkening too quickly.
4. Stir until there is no liquid left, continue stirring. Feel free to remove from heat if it seems to hot. Do not allow to smoke.  
5. Pour onto the prepared baking sheet, sprinkle with salt (or other seasoning), separating the peanuts and allow to cool.

### Roast Peanuts: 
1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Prepare baking sheet with [silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6) or parchment paper.
3. Bake for 7-10 minutes, then stir
4. Continue to bake until skins become loose, and peanuts start to look lightly roasted. 

### Chocolate cover the prepped peanuts
1. Simmer water in the bottom of a double boiler (sauce pan, with glass or metal bowl on top - do not wait to add glass bowl or it might shatter!). Do make sure all your peanuts can fit in this bowl with room!
2. While waiting for water to boil prepare a baking sheet with [silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6) or parchment paper. (optionally chill the tray to encourage it to set up faster when cooling)
3. Once simmering, add Chocolate to the bowl, and stir until melted. Turn the heat off for 5 - 10 minutes. 
4. Pour the cooled nuts into the chocolate, and stir until coated. You can cool for a few minutes here if the chocolate seems to thin. Stir again
5. Spoon onto the prepared baking tray into heaps the size you want your clusters to be. 
6. Set until firm!
7. Optionally melt white chocolate, or peanut butter to drizzle on top, or add sprinkles or flaky salt!
