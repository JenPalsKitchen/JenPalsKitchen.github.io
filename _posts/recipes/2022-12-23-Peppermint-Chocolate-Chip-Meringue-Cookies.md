This light fluffy melt in your mouth cookie is my absolute favorite christmas cookie!

Time: 
Last time I made it on [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/jenpalskitchen), it took me about 2 hours
* 15 minutes prepping ingredients 
* 45 minutes to get to stiff peaks
* 10 minutes mixing in chocolate chips and putting in piping bag
* 20 minutes piping / sprinkles
* 20 minutes bake, and then I leave in the oven to cool


## Ingredients: 
* 3 egg whites <sup>* 1</sup>
* 1/8 tsp iodized table salt
* 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
* 1/4 tsp peppermint extract <sup>* 2</sup>
* 3/4 cup or 150 g granulated sugar
* 6 oz mini semi sweet chocolate chips <sup>* 3</sup> 
* 1 tooth pick of green gel food coloring (optional) 


## Instructions:
1. Wash bowl/whisk 3 times to make sure no fat on it, otherwise you will not get stiff peaks 
2. Beat egg whites, cream of tartar, salt, extract, and food coloring until foamy
3. Beat in 1 tbsp sugar at a time, then beat until stiff peaks 
4. Fold in chocolate chips
5. Preheat oven to 300&deg;F
6. Line cookie sheet with parchment or silpat mat <sup>* 4</sup>
7. Drop spoonfuls or pipe batter onto cookie sheet, they can be fairly close together. They will not spread very much. 
8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, checking halfway through, until just a touch of darkening on edges and they don't look wet anymore.
9. Turn off oven and leave for atleast an hour, preferably overnight <sup>* 5</sup>

## Recommended Equipment 
* [Silicone baking mat](https://amzn.to/3sw03H6)
* [Insulated baking sheet - large](https://amzn.to/3onii0g)
* [Stand Mixer](https://amzn.to/3FRzC5n)

## Notes 
1. There are many uses for the egg yolks, one of mine is to make custard, or egg nog!
2. You can also make this vanilla chocolate chip by using vanilla extract, or other extracts for other fun combinations.
3. Technically the chocolate chips are optional, and it would make it much easier to pipe if you wanted better control of your meringue cookie shapes.
4. If not using liner on pan, grease pan with crisco
5. Make sure to put something on the controls for the oven so someone doesn't accidentally turn it on with the cookies in there!
