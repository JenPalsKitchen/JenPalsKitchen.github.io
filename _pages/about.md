I am a home cook, baker and streamer on twitch based out of the south-east US. You can expect a lot of cooking and baking with mishaps that we can usually turn around! We learn together, and I'm hoping to help everyone realize cooking good food is attainable with the help of google, even when mishaps occur! I began my journey streaming Food and Drink Twitch on Christmas eve/day 2020 and have been loving it ever since.   

### When Do I stream?  

Generally I stream Monday and Wendesday evenings around 5-6PM ET. 

### What do we do on stream?

Generally we start with cooking dinner and follow it up with making a dessert.  Occaionally we will make a drink in between as well. Many times this is determined with the help of a [holiday calendar](https://www.checkiday.com/).

### You're on twitch do you play games?

Mainly we stream in the Food and Drink category but, I play games occasionally and am impressively bad at remembering controls, but always having a good time!
